Welcome to the Kiteboarding Weather Predictor repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive and interactive weather forecasting application specifically designed for kiteboarders. With the help of various Python libraries and APIs, we have built a user-friendly tool that allows kiteboarders to determine the best times to ride based on their weight, the wind speed, and the kite sizes they own.

The application fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and historical weather data from various sources. It leverages machine learning algorithms to predict future weather trends and displays this information using interactive charts and maps. Users can enter a location of their choice, and the application will present them with detailed weather forecasts, as well as insights on historical trends and patterns, tailored for kiteboarding sessions.

## Key Features

- Real-time weather data retrieval from OpenWeatherMap API
- 8-Day kiteboarding weather data visualization
- Interactive charts and maps for better user experience
- Customizable location input
- Easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit
- Tailored weather forecasts for kiteboarders based on their weight, wind speed, and kite sizes

Whether you're a kiteboarding enthusiast, a traveler looking for accurate weather forecasts for your next ride, or someone interested in exploring the patterns of our planet's climate, this Kiteboarding Weather Predictor application is designed for you. Dive in and explore the world of weather forecasting with us, and make the most of your kiteboarding sessions!
